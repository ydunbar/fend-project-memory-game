# Udacity FEND Memory Game Project

## Project Overview

HTML and CSS styling was provided to display a static version of the Memory Game project, and students were asked to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This project involved modifying the HTML and CSS files, and developing the functionality in JavaScript.

## Game Functionality

Clicking on cards will flip them and reveal their symbol. Cards with matching symbols will stay flipped and add to your score. The game is over when all cards are matched. A star rating is calculated based on the time to match all the cards.

## How to Play
